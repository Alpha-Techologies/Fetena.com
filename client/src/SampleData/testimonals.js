      "I found Fetena.com at the start of the school year and I've told everyone about it.I was in love with the app and it's about the only way I got through teaching and assessing in the Fall. As a math teacher, it did all of the things I needed it to. It has a great equation editor that was super easy to learn and use. It has Desmos included so students could graph and then include the files and it was easy for them to upload their work so I could continue to grade for partial credit. I spent the time to set up my assessments using auto grading which was really helpful.",

      "I have had a great experience with Exam.net. I specifically likeUploading a PDF file made it a seamless transition to a more secure platform. The ability to share the exam with other teachers. I use the ‘preview exam’ option to create an answer key for myself so it is formatted the same way as the student answer sheets. Overall the secure browser has allowed me to have peace of mind that I am doing my best to keep it an even playing ground for all students to prevent cheating.",

      "Fetena.com was a lifesaver when our school had to pivot during exams to a distance based model. It was so good we want to use it for all exams from now on. It is really simple and easy to use. It saves on paper but more importantly as a teacher it saved me so much time marking! The auto marking was great, the functionality of listing criteria to mark against on long answer questions was so helpful especially when different teachers were marking. It also allowed some great tools like internal calculators, dictionaries and pdf uploads. Our exams look more professional and they are simpler and easier to mark what could be better!",

      "Exam.net is the most user-friendly platform for designing and administering tests. Students also love it! There are several extremely positive features such as: the inability of test-takers to visit other websites and “borrow” information for the tests (which helps prevent plagiarism), observing the amount of text produced by the test-takers in real-time, the simple self-explanatory design and layout of tests,the option to use chat with students and when I use medium security tests, test-takers are required to provide a justification if they leave their exam window before they are allowed re-enter to continue taking the test. Overall, Exam.net is reliable and stress-free.",

      "I teach principles of Computer Architectures to the freshmen entering the 3-years bachelor degree in Computer Systems and Networks Security (around 250 students every year). I used Exam.net with SEB during the last two years, and I am definitely satisfied about the characteristics of this platform. About the Exam.net features I found most useful, I can mention: the possibility of observing in real time what every student already wrote in her/his exam, thus allowing me to monitor student work and to identify suspect behaviors; the control tools available: timer, possibility of forcing end of single exams as well as of the whole class; the chat, allowing interactions with single students without disturbing the overall class; the easiness of setting up exams and of duplicating them for students requiring different timing limits, as it happens e.g. for students affected by Specific Learning Disorders, allowed by the Italian law to have additional time.",

There is also smart protection, in case student want to use additional source for the test, but not his own knowledge. The tests are afterwards, processed easily and the results are clear. I recommend Exam. net to all my colleagues.",
